# Task 5 — Cross-page CSS completeness

Append-only per-group record. Each group: browser RED → exact missing computed style →
smallest scoped fix in `storefront_builder.css` → prove Home unchanged → prove non-Home
envelopes → desktop/tablet/mobile → review → bounded commit.

## Setup facts (apply to every group in this task)

- Home CSS: `apps/catalog/static/css/home.css`, loaded ONLY by `catalog/templates/catalog/home.html`
  (confirmed: no `storefront_builder.css` reference anywhere in that template).
- Shared non-Home CSS: `apps/storefront_builder/static/css/storefront_builder.css`, loaded by
  all 5 non-Home public envelopes (product_detail, listing/search, collection, cart).
- Because Home never loads `storefront_builder.css`, every fix in this task is
  **structurally incapable** of affecting Home's own rendering — "prove Home unchanged" is
  verified by (a) confirming that structural fact and (b) a sanity request against
  `catalog:home` returning 200 with no console errors, rather than needing to diff Home's
  rendered output before/after (there is nothing for the fix to change there).
- Verification technique: computed-style RED/GREEN proof requires a real browser (a Django
  test client cannot evaluate `getComputedStyle`), so each group is verified with a small
  scratch Playwright script against a live `manage.py runserver` instance, run against the
  real dev DB with an explicit backup/restore around the fixture mutation (SHA256-verified
  clean afterward, matching the certified R4 QA harness's own backup/restore discipline).
  The scratch script itself is not committed to the repo — it is a verification tool, not a
  certified harness family (that is Task 6's job, via the Task 4 `PHASE3_FAMILIES`
  mechanism). The PERMANENT regression guard committed to the repo is a Django
  `TestCase` per group in `test_phase4_task5_cross_page_css.py` that (a) renders the section
  on a non-Home page via the real Draft→Publish→Public flow and asserts the markup appears,
  and (b) asserts the exact CSS declarations the fix depends on are present in
  `storefront_builder.css` — RED-verified via `git stash` on the CSS file only.

## Group A1 — `hero_banner` (default `overlay` style) + `image_slider`

### Result: PASS

### Investigation

A background research pass (read-only) traced both section keys to their templates:
- `hero_banner`'s default style and `image_slider` (which has no `variants` at all) both
  render through the exact same 1-line include,
  `apps/storefront_builder/templates/storefront_builder/partials/hero_slider_body.html` —
  one root cause, not two, confirming the plan's grouping of these two together.
- The investigation also checked the plan's stated hypothesis that `product_section`'s
  spotlight mode and `amazing_offers` "share the same promo-card CSS root" (also listed
  under Group A) and found it **incorrect**: the two use completely disjoint CSS class
  families (`.product-spotlight-*` reusing the shared `.pcard` partial vs. `.special-*`
  hand-rolling its own markup, zero selector overlap). Per the plan's own explicit
  instruction ("re-verify this grouping ... split out if the root causes turn out
  unrelated"), Group A is therefore split into three independent, separately-verified,
  separately-committed fixes: **A1** (this entry, hero_banner + image_slider), **A2**
  (product_section campaign_band/spotlight), **A3** (amazing_offers).

### Browser RED (before fix)

Fixture: real dev DB (`db.sqlite3`), backed up first (SHA256 `d53a687b...`, matching every
prior harness run's baseline). Added a `hero_banner` section (default settings, `hero_style:
"overlay"`) to the `akhlaghi` store's Cart page via `section_structure_service.add_section`,
attached one `HeroSlide` (title only, no image — proving the container/text layout
independent of image decode), published, then loaded `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/cart/` in a
real headless Chromium (the same `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194` binary the certified
harness uses) and read `getComputedStyle`:

| Selector | Property | Expected (per home.css) | Actual (RED) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.hero-slide` | `position` | `absolute` | `static` |
| `.hero-slide` | `inset` | `0px` | `auto` |
| `.hero-media` | `display` | `block` | `inline` |

Confirms the section's HTML renders (shared Django template, unaffected by CSS), but its
layout is completely unstyled off-Home — matching the investigation's prediction exactly.

### Fix

Mirrored the base "universal image-first hero" block and the Phase-3.7
`data-text-position` rules verbatim from `home.css` (lines 7-43, 840-847) into
`storefront_builder.css`, placed just before the existing `.hero-luxury-*` block (the only
other hero-related CSS already in that file). Scoped narrowly: only the selectors the
`overlay`/no-variant hero body actually emits — `.hero`, `.hero-inner` (+
`[data-text-position]` variants), `.hero-slide`(`.single`), `.hero-media`(`img`),
`.hero-text`(`h1`/`p`), `.hero-cta`, `.hero-arrow`(`-prev`/`-next`), `.hero-tabs`(`button`) —
plus their two documented responsive breakpoints (`max-width:1000px`, `max-width:680px`).
Did NOT mirror the Home-only `.rcontainer:has(.hero):has(.product-section--spotlight)`
row-co-placement rule (a Home multi-column-row feature, not required for this section to
render correctly standalone) or the other hero style variants (`split`,
`beauty_editorial`, `chocolate_carousel`, `atelier_triptych` — out of this group's scope,
Group A explicitly covers only the default `overlay` style).

### Browser GREEN (after fix), desktop/tablet/mobile, two envelopes

Re-ran the same fixture flow (hero_banner on Cart, image_slider on Listing — a second,
independent placement proving the shared-template fix works identically) at
1440×900/768×1024/390×844:

| Viewport | `.hero-inner` position | `.hero-inner` height (aspect-ratio applied) | `.hero-slide` position/inset | Console errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1440×900 (Cart) | `relative` | 464px | `absolute` / `0px` | 0 |
| 768×1024 (Cart) | `relative` | 308px | `absolute` / `0px` | 0 |
| 390×844 (Cart) | `relative` | 300px | `absolute` / `0px` | 0 |
| 1440×900 (Listing, image_slider) | — | — | `absolute` / `0px` | 0 |

The changing height per viewport confirms the responsive `aspect-ratio` breakpoints are
also active, not just the base rule.

### Home unchanged

`catalog/templates/catalog/home.html` confirmed to never reference `storefront_builder.css`
(structural proof, not just an empirical non-diff). `catalog:home` returns 200 with 0
console errors both before and after the fix (sanity check, not a before/after diff, since
nothing could have changed).

### Cleanup

Dev server stopped; `db.sqlite3` restored from the pre-fixture backup, SHA256-verified
identical to the original (`d53a687b...`) — no residue left in the shared dev DB.

### Permanent regression guard

`apps/storefront_builder/tests/test_phase4_task5_cross_page_css.py`,
`HeroSliderNonHomeCssCompletenessTests` (4 tests): renders `hero_banner` on Cart and
`image_slider` on Listing via the real Draft→Publish→Public flow and asserts the markup
appears; asserts the load-bearing CSS declarations are present in
`storefront_builder.css` (RED-verified via `git stash` on the CSS file only — fails with
the exact missing-declaration `AssertionError` before the fix, passes after); asserts Home
never loads `storefront_builder.css` and still renders 200.

### Verification

- New suite: **4/4 pass**. RED confirmed via `git stash` (CSS-only) — the CSS-content
  assertion fails with the precise missing-declaration error; the markup-rendering
  assertions are unaffected by the CSS file (as expected — they test template rendering,
  not layout).
- Regression sweep: `test_phase4_task5_cross_page_css` + `test_qa_harness_contract` +
  `test_r4_settings_schema` + `test_section_registry` + `test_render_service` — **433
  tests, 0 failures, 1 known skip**.
- `python manage.py check`: clean. `makemigrations --check --dry-run`: no changes (no model
  touched).

### STOP conditions checked

Pure CSS-completeness fix — no new template, no new section registration, no schema
change, no new renderer path. Not a design expansion (Ruling D): mirrors existing,
already-shipped Home styling verbatim, adds no new visual variant.
